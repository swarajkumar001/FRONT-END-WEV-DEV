    <h2> Qualities of a Good Leader</h2>
    <p class="bold">
        First of all, confidence is the most quality. 
        A leader must have strong self-confidence.
         A person lacking in confidence can never be a good leader. 
         A person must be confident enough to ensure others follow him.

            Abraham Lincoln was another notable leader. 
            Most noteworthy, he ended the slavery system in the United States. 
            Consequently, he made many enemies. However, he was a man of massive self-confidence. 
            His struggle against slavery certainly became an inspiration.
