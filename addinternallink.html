        <h3> advantages and dis advantages of online class</h3>
        <h4> advantage sof online class </h4>
        <p>
            Although many people still consider traditional classes as the best way 
            for learning but in this technological age online classes system of 
            learning proves to be a great alternative of traditional classes. 
            In online class system students have the chance to study from the easy of their home. 
            Students can take classes at the time when they preferred as most of the classes are recorded.
            Online classes system of learning helps participants to learn whenever they want to learn,
             leaving them the freedom to choose the time for study. Many schools, 
             institutions and universities are providing online classes free of costs. 
             Thus online classes are helpful for those students who earlier could not pay fees. 
             Now they are accessing these online classes online for free. 
             Among the advantages of online classes system of learning there are the responsibility 
             and self-discipline of students in online class system.
        </p>
        <h4>Disadvantages of Online Classes</h4>
        <p> 
            At school or in traditional class system students learn how to make friends,
             how to behave with teacher and friends, how to get rid of disappointment etc.
              The main work of personality development of students can be done through traditional classes
              . In online classes these all are missing. Online learning cannot offer face to face human 
              interaction which are very important for personality development.

            Online classes system can be difficult for some persons who don't know 
            the proper use of technological instruments. For small children online classes 
            requires great disciplines and practice. It also requires more interventions of
             parents in case of small children. In online classes student use electronic devices
              like mobile, tablet, laptops or computer. Use of these devices for longer time will
               badly affect the health of students.
